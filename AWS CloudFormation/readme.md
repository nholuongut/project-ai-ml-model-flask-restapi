## CloudFormation Overview

AWS CloudFormation lets you model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating infrastructure as code.

## Important Consideration 
In this example, we demonstrate how to create a AWS Redshift stack.  
You will need to make one change to this template. You will need to supply your public IP address under the RSIngress1 rule.  
Set the CidrIp: to your public IP address.  
```YAML
RSIngress1:  
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress'  
    DependsOn: RSSecurityGroup  
    Properties:  
      CidrIp: 000.00.000.000/32
```
