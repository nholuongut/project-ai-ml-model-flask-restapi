## Airflow Overview

Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines.

## Airflow Docker Image 
In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to create a custom docker image.  
In this video, we will cover how to install Apache Airflow on Docker. During this tutorial, we will build a custom Docker image of Airflow with
additional libraries such as SQL Server provider since we have covered SQL Server as a source in the previous Airflow videos. 
I have covered the Airflow and Airflow Dag in this video here if you like to check it out.
